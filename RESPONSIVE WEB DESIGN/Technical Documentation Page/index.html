      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of the digital
        realm. It empowers web developers to craft the structure and content of
        websites. Through a system of tags and elements, HTML defines how
        information is presented on the web. Whether it's text, images, links,
        or multimedia, HTML provides the essential framework for web browsers to
        render and display content. This language underpins the internet, making
        it the first step in web development. In this introductory journey,
        we'll unravel the fundamental concepts of HTML, laying the foundation
        for creating compelling and interactive online experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript further enhance HTML's
        capabilities, enabling stunning designs and interactivity. In this
        exploration, we'll delve into HTML's syntax, tags, and attributes,
        equipping you with the skills to structure web content effectively. Get
        ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of web
        development!
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're a budding web designer or simply curious about the inner
        workings of the internet, this HTML primer will empower you. We'll
        demystify the creation of headings, paragraphs, forms, and more,
        unlocking the potential to build your web presence. Let's begin this
        exciting odyssey into the heart of the digital landscape, where HTML is
        your key to crafting captivating online experiences.
      </p>
      <p>An HTML page is defined like this inside an HMTL file.</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
        &lt;html lang="en">
        &lt;head>
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8">
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        &lt;title>Document&lt;/title>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
            
        &lt;/body>
        &lt;/html>
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="main-doc">
      <div class="main-section" id="tags"></div>
      <h1>Tags</h1>

      <p>
        Tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML (HyperText Markup
        Language) and play a pivotal role in structuring web content. They are
        enclosed within angle brackets and serve as instructions to web browsers
        on how to display information. Tags come in pairs: an opening tag, which
        begins an element, and a closing tag, which ends it. They work together
        to define the start and end points of content elements, such as
        headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Additionally, tags can
        carry attributes, providing additional information or properties to
        elements. Understanding and effectively utilizing tags is essential for
        crafting well-structured and visually appealing web pages.
      </p>

      <p>Some examples of Tags</p>
      <p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag groups content.</p>
      <p><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> defines top-level headings.</p>
      <p><code>&lt;button&gt;</code> creates interactive buttons.</p>
      <p><code>&lt;img&gt;</code> embeds images.</p>
      <p><code>&lt;form&gt;</code> builds interactive forms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-doc">
      <div class="main-section" id="forms"></div>
      <h1>Forms</h1>
      <p>
        Forms are a crucial component of web interactivity, enabling users to
        input and submit data. The <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element serves as a
        container, encompassing various form elements like text fields,
        checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forms facilitate essential online activities, including user
        registration, login, search queries, and data submission. Attributes
        like <code>action</code> define where the form data is sent, while
        <code>method</code> specifies the HTTP method, often "GET" or "POST."
        Input validation ensures data accuracy, enhancing user experience and
        security.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript can enhance forms with dynamic behavior and real-time
        validation. Accessibility considerations, like providing descriptive
        labels and error messages, make forms inclusive to all users. Forms are
        indispensable tools for user interaction and data collection on the web.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-doc">
      <div class="main-section" id="buttons"></div>
      <h1>Buttons</h1>
      <p>
        Buttons in web design are interactive elements, triggered by users to
        perform actions like submitting forms, navigating pages, or executing
        JavaScript functions. They enhance user experience and interactivity.
      </p>
      <p>Buttons are cool, here is an example</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;button onclick="dothisfunction">Click me&lt;/button>
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The provided HTML code demonstrates a button element. When clicked, it
        triggers a JavaScript function named "dothisfunction." This button,
        labeled "Click me," adds interactivity to web pages, allowing users to
        initiate custom actions or behaviors defined by the associated
        JavaScript function
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-doc">
      <div class="main-section" id="dom"></div>
      <h1>The DOM</h1>

      <p>The DOM list is</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the defining document</li>
        <li>A way to manage data</li>
        <li>A tree of HTML tags</li>
        <li>The structure of HTML</li>
        <li>The document object model (DOM)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a crucial concept in web development.
        It represents the structure of web documents, like HTML or XML, as a
        tree-like structure. Each element in a webpage, such as headings,
        paragraphs, and images, is represented as a node in the DOM tree. The
        DOM enables web developers to manipulate web content dynamically using
        programming languages like JavaScript. It allows for the addition,
        modification, or deletion of elements and their attributes, facilitating
        interactive and responsive web applications. The DOM also acts as a
        bridge between the content displayed in a web browser and the underlying
        code, making it a fundamental part of modern web development, powering
        interactive and dynamic web experiences.
      </p>
      <p>The DOM tree is nested HTML tags</p>

      <pre><code>
        &lt;div>
            &lt;section>
                &lt;h1>&lt;/h1>
            &lt;/section>
        &lt;/div>
        &lt;div>&lt;/div>
        &lt;div>
            &lt;div>
                &lt;button>&lt;/button>
            &lt;/div>
            &lt;div>&lt;/div>
        &lt;/div>
      </code></pre>

      <p>A Document Object Model (DOM) tree is a fundamental concept in web development, representing the hierarchical structure of HTML tags in a web page. It serves as the foundation for web browsers to understand and manipulate web content. At the root of the tree is the <html> tag, branching into <head> and <body> elements. Within these, various tags like &lt;title>, &lt;meta>, &lt;script>, and &lt;div> create further branches, forming a nested structure. Each tag becomes a node in the DOM tree, enabling dynamic interactions with the page through JavaScript. This tree-like structure facilitates efficient navigation and modification of web content, making it a crucial concept for web developers.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
